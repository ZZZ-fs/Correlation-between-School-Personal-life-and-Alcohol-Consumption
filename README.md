Seeking factors of alcohol over-consumption is the best way to prevent the progression of addiction. Therefore, our group decides to do some statistical analysis to detect what factors might lead to studentsâ€™ alcohol over-consumption. Specifically, we want to analyze whether alcohol consumption will be impacted by different features we selected, like school, sex, age, locations, academic behaviors, health situations, and family relationships. Additionally, we would like to make a fit model to predict what kind of students are more likely to consume more alcohol.
